                <h3>11 million devs actively use JavaScript :</h3>
                <p>
            In Asia, nearly 2 out of 5 developers build apps for messaging platforms and/or chatbots. However, only 22% of North American and Western European devs are developing messaging or chatbot apps. The popularity of messaging apps such as LINE and WeChat in Asian countries may be the reason for the high number of messaging platform devs.

                <h3>Understanding and Creating ChatBots :</h3>
                <p>
                     It is not uncommon to come across a site where you are asked to chat, or where a question is posted to you that starts a conversation. It is getting harder to tell if you are talking with a person or with an automated system. Often, the entity on the other side of a chat is an automated system or bot, and not a real person !

                <p>
                One of the aspects that will be greatly improved in 2020 is animation. Animation and GIFs are already an important part of every website and every mobile app. Thanks to HTML and JavaScript software development loading time will be shorter and website speed will be increased. Websites will become more responsive and their SEO will be better.
